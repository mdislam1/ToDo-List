      <p>
        Hello, my name is Kyle Janssen. This is my second year here at Wayne State, and hopefully
        last before i finish my bachelors degree in Computer Science. I started out at Schoolcraft College
        for 2 years to get the majority of my gen ed courses out of the way.
        <br/>
        Sadly, I don't have much working experience in the field yet, covid kind of threw a wrench in that.
        Instead of that, ill mention a couple electives i took that i enjoyed massively (electives because im sure most of us has had similar courses when it comes to required ones).
        One being Human Computer Interactions, which was a course that covers the basics in all fields involving
        how a user can interface with technology. Another really interesting elective i took here has
        been Intro to Cyber-Physical Systems, which taught me how engineering will cross with computer science (we coded a lot using arduino).
        Those were probably my favorite electives i took, but i also have dabbled a bit in networking and cybersecurity either on my own
        time or at schoolcraft.

      <p>
          Greetings! My name is Samuel Aggor, I am a senior in computer science and entering my last year towards graduating with a B.S. degree in C.S.
          I have been learning how to make video games and creating concept art regarding certain topics or genres that I would like to explore as a video game designer as well 
          as a person playing the finish product of a video game. I started life poor and not having much to my name but my books I had on me, but gradually excelled in Mathematics, 
          English, Science, and History. Video games and art are my passion, and I would like to pursue my career as a Video game designer. 
          <br/>
          I started to like video games when I was very young and received one of Sonyâ€™s demo disks in the mail and played the various titles. 
          My favorite ones were The Legend of Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, and The Legend of Dragoon. Those were truly memorable times. Now, I play Destiny, Halo, and Final Fantasy
          franchise games and have grown a fond appreciation of their story telling and art. I plan to travel and go to school in Canada for video game design and film to improve 
          my abilities. I have a few titles that I am working on in my spare time and proceed to work at a desirable company that practices good work ethics. 
          I hope I can measure up and beyond those titles one day.

        Hi there! My name is Sabih Ijaz. I am a senior finishing my last year of computer science currently. One additional fun fact about me would be that I have no real dominant hand and switch it up by task.
